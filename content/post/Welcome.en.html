The Symphonic Garden is an interactive sound piece that lives in a garden.
<br/>The experience is a dialogue in real time between nature and sound.
<br/>The sounds respond to and change according to data from the weather and the growth of the plants in the garden.
The garden sings the sounds of growth and slowing down of the wind blowing through the leaves and branches,
or the sun changing it's locations throughout the day and between the humidity or dryness of the earth.
<br/>The work allows us to listen to the changes of nature over time
and the development of nature through the beauty of the vegetation and the music's response to it.
